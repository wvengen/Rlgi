- try to make lgi.par?apply always work when R's ?apply works (result merging)
- report all statuses in lgi.parParApply
- show error messages and warnings from remote workers
- error handling when one job fails
- allow to fetch results when parallel submission wait was interrupted
- local computation if remote takes too long
- add option to delete LGI jobs when result is safe
- write examples
- add&update tests

performance improvements:
- use shared GLOBAL/FUNCTION repository for parApply, generate only once
- remember results filename somehow so qstat isn't needed when fetching results
- add batch/arrayjob submission to LGI
