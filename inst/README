README

The RLGI package is an integration of the R Programming languages that allows R users to programatically integrate their R models with a Leiden Grid Infrastructure.

This implementation of RLGI is an adaptation of the Rsge package (which is based on the Rlsf package, etc..). Thanks to all the authors of these package to make this possible.

The program functions as follows:

1. call lgi.par(L|s|C|R)Apply(X, fun, ..., join.method=cbind, njobs) or lgi.apply 
2. The data object is split as specified by njobs or batch.size
3. Each data segment along with the function, arguemnt list (optionally global variables and library names) are saved to a shared network location using the save call.
4. Each worker process loads the saved file, creates the new environment, executes the saved function call (FUN), and saves the results to the shared network location. 
5. The master script uses join.method to merge the results together and returns the result.

(lgi.submit is similar, but does not split data and is asynchronous)

LICENSE
------
This code is licensed under GPL, use it, modify it, change it, but most of all, enjoy it.

INSTALLATION
------
To install this package, first ensure that snow if installed, then run the following. 

R CMD INSTALL RLGI

This package requires that the LGI client tools are installed, and user
configuration is setup in ~/.LGI.

  Nodes where this package is installed are referred to as submit nodes.
  Nodes where this package will distribute data for computation are referred to as compute nodes.

  SubmitNode:
    - LGI should be installed and configured
      - certificate and project settings should be configured in ~/.LGI
      - should have LGI_qsub, LGI_qstat and LGI_filetransfer in the path
    - R (tested with 2.6.1/2.7, may work with other versions)
    - R packages snow and RLGI installed.
  
  ComputeNode
    - R, RLGI, and snow should be installed
    - Other packages may be required if you use the “packages” option

Usage
------

To get more information about how to use this package, either see:
  - R docs,
  - check the test directory to see examples that I used for testing. 
       - ignore the framework, its a little too much.
  - Check out the source code, there are only a few hundred lines :)

Configuration:
