Quickstart for Rlgi
------

This is a short tutorial on how to get started with the RLGI R package as a
user. You need an administrator who has setup an LGI project server with R,
and who has given you a certificate for the project server.

 1. Setup your LGI configuration. When you have received an LGI.cfg from your
    system administrator, put that into your home directory. On Windows, this
    may be your personal "Documents and Settings" directory.
    If you don't have a pre-cooked configuration file, populate ~/.LGI with
    the following files:
      defaultserver    LGI project server you use
      defaultproject   LGI project you use
      user             your LGI username
      groups           groups you want to associate jobs with
      ca_chain         PEM-encoded certificate chain of certificate authority
      certificate      PEM-encoded certificate of your LGI account
      privatekey       PEM-encoded private key of your LGI account

 2. Install the RLGI package for R
    download the source from https://github.com/wvengen/Rlgi/tarball/Rlgi_0.0.7
    or when feeling experimental https://github.com/wvengen/Rlgi/tarball/master

 3. Start!


For example:

  $ #### Step 1: Setup LGI client configuration ####
  $ # (without pre-cooked LGI.cfg configuration file)
  $ mkdir -p ~/.LGI && cd ~/.LGI
  $ echo https://change.my.cool.project.server/LGI >defaultserver
  $ echo change.LGIproject >defaultproject
  $ cat /change/some/ca/chain.pem >ca_chain
  $ openssl pkcs12 -clcerts -nokeys -in /change/my/received/cert.p12 -out certificate
  $ openssl pkcs12 -nocerts -in /change/my/received/cert.p12 -out privatekey
  $ chmod 0600 privatekey
  $ openssl x509 -noout -subject -in certificate | sed 's/^.*CN=\([^;]\+\)\(;.*\)\?$/\1/' >user
  $ cat user >groups

  $ #### Step 2: Install RLGI package ####
  $ cd /tmp
  $ wget https://github.com/wvengen/Rlgi/tarball/Rlgi_0.0.7
  $ tar xzf Rlgi_?.?.?
  $ R CMD INSTALL *-Rlgi-*

  $ #### Step 3: Start! ####
  $ R
