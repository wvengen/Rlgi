LGI resource daemon scripts for R
---------------------------------

To use Rlgi one needs LGI one or more resource daemons that execute R programs,
and this directory contains an example configuration. Please refer to the LGI
documentation for more information on setting up resource daemons.

The scripts provided try to run the default 'R' application. If the program
`module` is installed, the corresponding module(*) is loaded.

When R is not found, a message is printed on stderr and the job is
rejected, so that another resource daemon might pick it up.


(*) See http://modules.sourceforge.net/ for the modules system. You
    may need to set MODULENAME and MODULEPATH in your resource
    daemon run script (and don't forget to export them).
